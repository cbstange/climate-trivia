# Climate Trivia

### The Climate Triva Quiz is designed to test the user's knowledge of the environmental impact humans have on the earth's climate. The quiz presents the user with a random question displaying four possible answers with only one being correct. The game ends at 10 questions and presents a user with the correct number of questions answered.

## Finished site deployment link can be found [here]().

## Planning

- Before starting the project I created a [wireframe](.//assets/planning/Climate_Quiz_Wireframe.pdf) and [flowchart](.//assets/planning/Climate_Quiz_Flowchart.pdf) to visualize the user journey - these documents  can be found in the credits below.
- Some of the questions are custom while others were used from other sources. For the custom questions, I reasearched a number of sources regarding climate change and 
- human impact. These sources are found below in the credits section.

## Existing Features
- Start Page with introduction and play button
