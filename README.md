## Planning

Before starting the project I created a [wireframe](.//assets/planning/Climate_Quiz_Wireframe.pdf) and [flowchart](.//assets/planning/Climate_Quiz_Flowchart.pdf) which can be found in the credits below.

## Existing Features
- ### Navigation Bar

  - Featured on all four pages, the navigation bar is fully responsive and includes a image that brings you back to the home screen and links for all other pages: Attractions, Restaurants and Outdoors.
  - The navigation bar's structure is meant to be familiar to users: when a user visits the site, it is clear how to navigate each page.
  - To add to usability, a hover effect was added so there is feedback to the user has they choose which page to visit.
